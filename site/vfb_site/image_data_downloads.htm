	<p>Please ensure that you <strong>cite the original authors</strong> when making use of the following data in any publication. We would also request that you cite the VFB project (see <a href="about_us.htm#citation">here</a>).</br>
	 The registrations for the Janelia FlyLight data, along with the mirroring registrations and bridging registrations used in the processing of the Ito and Cachero & Ostrovsky datasets were generated by members of the <a href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/jlabwww/Welcome.html"> Jefferis group</a> and will be described in a manuscript presently in preparation.</p>
	
	<h3>GAL4 images from Janelia Farm FlyLight</h3>

		<p>
			We found that the presence of the lamina in the original images decreased the registration success rate, although for the vast majority (3436 out of 3501) the central brain still registered well. The list of images with good overall registration (goodimages) is <a href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/goodimages.txt">here</a>. The list of images with good central brain registration (goodbrains) is <a href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/goodbrains.txt">here</a>. Following registration, the reformatted images were quantised to 8 bit.

		<h3>Neuroblast clones from Kei Ito</h3>

		<p>
			We used a flipping registration based on a spatially calibrated version of the JFRC/VFB template brain (JFRC2) to take data from the fly's right to the fly's left, which is where the original data lives. Specifically, we used this <a href="https://github.com/jefferislab/MirrorRegistrations/tree/6ad85f36a5c6fad0cff155df9adce9c5bc6bd16c/JFRC2_mirror.list">JFRC2 mirror registration</a> and this <a href="https://github.com/jefferislab/MirrorRegistrations/tree/6ad85f36a5c6fad0cff155df9adce9c5bc6bd16c/JFRC2_imgflip.list">JFRC2 flipping registration</a> as described in the readme <a href="https://github.com/jefferislab/MirrorRegistrations">here</a>.

		</p>

		<h3>Neuroblast clones from Tzumin Lee</h3>
		<p>
			We used a specific crop (vertical offset of 94 pixels) of the registered stacks supplied by Tzumin Lee in order to correct an offset difference and result in stacks in the same space as the JFRC2 template brain.

		<h3>Fruitless neuroblast clones from Cachero/Ostrovsky (Jefferis Group)</h3>
		
		<p>
		JFRC2 registered images of the fruitless neuroblast clones are provided <a href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/CacheroOstrovsky/Data/ExtractedClonesFullSize/" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
		<p> Both male and female versions are provided regardless of whether a sexual dimorphism was observed. The data were cross-registered against the JFRC2 template by applying <a href="https://github.com/jefferislab/BridgingRegistrations/tree/94dd5e4f54cf9918d26c62aa2a582d2cbafa1fe6/JFRC2_IS2.list">JFRC2_IS2 bridging registration</a>. The original data (registered against IS2 template) are available <a href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/CacheroOstrovsky/Data/ExtractedClonesFullSize/">here</a>.

		<h3>Supplementary files from BrainName paper</h3>
		
		<p>
			These are the supplementary image files of the BrainName paper <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.12.017">(Ito et al., 2014)</a>. It includes: 
			<ul>
			<li>A tricolor brain template (half-brain) displaying presynaptic, postsynaptic and neuronal counter stains.
			</li>
			<li>An Amira file with the labelled neuropil fields.
			</li>
			<li>An Amira file with the labelled tracts.
