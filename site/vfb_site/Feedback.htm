			<p>Alternatively, as VFB is an opensource project,   
			you can engage directly with our developer community on GitHub 
			[<a href="https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB" target="_new">VirtualFlyBrain/VFB</a>].</p> 
			<p>You can easily raise a new issue by clicking

			alt="https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB/issues/new">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p> This could simply be a question or a new feature request, but if you have found a bug we missed please include 
			the page address (${param.url}) and your browsers details (${browserName},${fullVersion}) to help us resolve any issue as quickly as possible.</p>
