  <h2>Find neurons that develop from one of the neuroblasts in the antennal lobe</h2>

<p>
    For more information on this type of query click <a href="../features.htm#querymenu">here</a>.
    </p>

  	<ul>
	  <li>
	 Go to the Anatomy/Neuron Finder page, accessible from the homepage or from the top menu "Tools-> Anatomy/Neuron Finder".
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  In the search box, start typing "antennal lobe"."<br/>
	  <b>Did you know?</b> You can also search by any known synonym, such as "AL".
	  </li>
	  <li>
	 A list of matching terms appears. The term list shrinks as you continue typing.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Once you see "adult antennal lobe" in the list, select it (you might have to scroll down).     
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  The page will now display the information for that term.
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	   The query menu ("Query for") is above the term. Hover over the tabs to the right to see all available of the available sub-options.  
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Select the query: "Lineage clones with: some part here".
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  A list with the query results will be displayed.
	</li>
	<li> Click on 'More info' to see more details about each lineage clone, including synonyms and thumbnail image. You can see any of the lineage clones on the 3D Brain Viewer by clicking "See in Viewer". In this way you will be able to overlay any of the painted neuropil domains on the brain, together with the lineage clone.
		</li>
		<li>
			To find neurons, or other clones that are part of this lineage select the query: "Component of".
	<br/>
	  <b>Did you know?</b> If you know which neuroblast lineage you are looking for, you can search directly for: "adult X lineage clone", where X is the neuroblast you want.
	  </li>
	<li>
		A list of neuron types is displayed. For each, you can see all the information available by clicking on "More info". Choose your desired neuron type. On the term info page for that neuron type, in addition to the usual information, a few image examples are displayed as thumbnails. To see the complete list and to be able to see the neurons in the 3D Viewer, click on "Show all".<br/>
		<b>Did you know?</b> From this term info page, you can also directly query for transgenes expressed in that neuron class.
		</li>
		<li> The list is organised in 4 columns: name of the neuron, thumbnail which displays the neuron in the 3D Viewer, neuron type and driver used.
			</li>
			<li>
			To see a neuron in the Viewer, click on "See in Viewer" in the first column, or click on the thumbnail. On the term info page, below the Viewer, all the information relative to that neuron will be displayed, together with a thumbnail. 
			</li>
			<li>You can also create a composite view, to compare image stacks with each others (eg. compare one neuron to a lineage clone). From the Viewer, click on "Add to composite view". Now use your browser "Back" button to go back to the Anatomy/Neuron Finder. Search for a lineage clone and click on "See in viewer" link. Again, click on "Add to composite view". To display the composite, click on "View composite" on the "Edit composite view" page.
