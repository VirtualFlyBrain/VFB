  <h3>Find neurons that develop from one of the neuroblasts in the antennal lobe</h3>

<p>
    For more information on this type of query click <a href="../features.htm#querymenu">here</a>.
    </p>

  	<ul>
	  <li>
	 Go to the <a href="../../tools/query_builder/index.htm">Anatomy/Neuron Finder</a> page, accessible from the homepage or from the top menu <i>Tools-> Anatomy/Neuron Finder</i>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  In the search box, start typing <i>antennal lobe</i>.<br/>
	  <b>Did you know?</b> You can also search by any known synonym, such as <i>AL</i>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	 A list of matching terms appears. The term list shrinks as you continue typing.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Once you see <i>adult antennal lobe</i> in the list, select it (you might have to scroll down).     
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  The page will now display the information for that term.
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	   Further query options are available from <i>Query for</i>. Hover the tabs to the right to see all options.   
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Select the query: <i>Lineage clones with: some part here</i>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  A list with the query results will be displayed.
	</li>
	<li> Click on <i>More info</i> to see more details about each lineage clone, including synonyms and thumbnail image. You can see any of the lineage clones on the <a href="../../../site/stacks/index.htm">Stack Viewer</a> by clicking <i>See in Viewer</i>. In this way you will be able to overlay any of the painted neuropil domains on the brain, together with the lineage clone.
		</li>
		<li>
			To find neurons, or other clones that are part of this lineage select the query: <i>Component of</i>.
	<br/>
	  <b>Did you know?</b> If you know which neuroblast lineage you are looking for, you can search directly for <i>adult X lineage clone</i>, where X is the neuroblast you want.
	  </li>
	<li>
		A list of neuron types is displayed. For each, you can see all the information available by clicking on <i>More info</i>. Choose your desired neuron type. On the term info page for that neuron type, in addition to the usual information, a few image examples are displayed as thumbnails. To see the complete list and to be able to see the neurons in the 3D Viewer, click on <i>Show all</i>.<br/>
		<b>Did you know?</b> From this term info page, you can also directly query for transgenes expressed in that neuron class.
		</li>
		<li> The list is organised in 4 columns: name of the neuron, thumbnail which displays the neuron in the 3D Viewer, neuron type and driver used.
			</li>
			<li>
			To see a neuron in the Viewer, click on <i>See in Viewer</i> in the first column, or click on the thumbnail. On the term info page, below the Viewer, all the information relative to that neuron will be displayed, together with a thumbnail. 
			</li>
			<li>You can also create a composite view, to compare image stacks with each others (eg. compare one neuron to a lineage clone). From the Viewer, click on <i>Add to composite view</i>. Now use your browser <i>Back</i> button to go back to the Anatomy/Neuron Finder. Search for a lineage clone and click on <i>See in viewer</i> link. Again, click on <i>Add to composite view</i>. To display the composite, click on <i>View composite</i> on the </i>Edit composite view</i> page.
