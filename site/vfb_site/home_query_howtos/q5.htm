  	<ul>
	  <li>
	 Go to the <a href="../../tools/query_builder/index.htm"<Anatomy/Neuron Finder</a> page, accessible from the homepage or from the top menu Tools ->  Query Builder.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  In the search box above the anatomy tree, start typing 'lobula'<br/>
	  </li> 
	  <li>
	  A list of matching terms appears. The term list shrinks as you continue typing.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Once you see 'lobula' in the list, select it (you might have to scroll down).   
	  </li>

	  The query text below will be updated to reflect your query.      
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Select the directionality of the connectivity, by changing the type of terminals from 'synaptic' to 'postsynaptic' using the dropdown menu to the right of the term.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Repeat the same steps for 'medulla'.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Check the query text in the 'Your query' panel. When happy with it, click the 'Execute' button at the bottom of the 'Your query' panel.
