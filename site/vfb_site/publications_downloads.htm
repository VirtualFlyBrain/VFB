		<p>
			Currently on the site (since June 2013), FlyCircuit neurons
			<a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.056">(Chiang et al., 2011, Curr. Biol. 21(1): 1--11)</a> are identified by their neuron name (eg. fru-M-200266), and not by their gene name (eg. FruMARCM-M002262_seg001) as initially.
			</p>
			<p>
			The csv file below provides you with the mapping for FlyCircuit identifiers for neurons. It contains the neuron idid (eg. 1), gene name and neuron name. It also contains the VFB ids for each of the neurons, which are used to run all internal queries.

		<h3>Ontologies</h3>
		<p>
			Our query system runs on the most current version of the Drosophila anatomy ontology, which is developed in collaboration with FlyBase. You can download different versions of the latest release of the anatomy ontology in obo or owl formats from <a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBbt/">here</a>.<br/> 
			<br/>
			Click <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/fbbtdv/wiki/download_guide/">here</a> for more information on the difference between the various versions of the ontology. For most users, the version fbbt-simple should be sufficient. Help on how to browse and query the ontology is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/fbbtdv/wiki/options_for_browsing_and_querying/">here</a>.
