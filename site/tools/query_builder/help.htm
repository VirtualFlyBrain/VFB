	<p>
		This tools allows you to build more complex queries and to search for
		neurons that innervate two or more neuropil domains, specifying the
		directionality of that innervation.
		<br />
		This page is divided into 2 main areas: the window on the right will
		display the query, the other windows are the same as in Brain Stack
		page. The left most window corresponds to the Stack Viewer, on the
		right is the interactive anatomy tree, and the lower panel corresponds
		to the term info window. For more information on the Stack Viewer
		please see those help pages.
	</p>

	<h2>Creating and executing a query</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Select the anatomy terms to be included in the query. This can be
			done by by browsing the anatomy tree or by using the auto-complete
			search above it. You can double-clicking on a region of stack (will
			colour-highlight it), which will highlight it in the tree. </li>
		<li>Once the anatomy term of interest has been located, use the menu
			at the top of the term info window, and choose 'Add to the query'.
		</li>
		<li>On the query window, select the directionality of the innervation
			by specifying the type of terminals using the drop-down box. Options for
			synaptic, pre- or post-synaptic are available.</li>
		<li>Repeat the previous step to add as many terms as required. Each
			anatomy term will represent one query leg.</li>
		<li>
			Before executing the query, the number of expected results (Records found)
			is presented to allow the user to decide whether or not to proceed,
			or to see the effects of adding/removing a query leg.
		</li>
		<li>When you have finished composing a query, press the "Execute"
			button to execute it. </li>
		<li> The query results will be shown as a list. Clicking on 'More
			info' for a term displays the information page for that term. The
			same information would be displayed in the Anatomy/Neuron Finder page
			or on the Term info window (if it is a neuropil domain).</li>
	</ul>
