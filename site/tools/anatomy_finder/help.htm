	This tool allows searches for neuropil domains, neurons lineage clones and tracts. In addition
	to the information displayed for each term, further query options for a
	selected term are available.
	<br />
	Queries include: neuron subclasses, neuron classes by location,
	innervation (with the option of specifying pre- or postsynaptic
	terminals) or lineage, single neuron images by location, tracts, gene/transgene
	expression and phenotype. The query options available depend on whether
	the selected term is a neuropil domain, a neuron/lineage clone or a tract. <br />
	If images are available, thumbnails will also be displayed at the bottom of the page.

<h2>How to search for information on a term</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Start typing the name of a term (neuron class, lineage clone, tract, neuropil) in the auto-complete search box.
		Synonyms can be used.</li>
	<li>A list of possible terms will appear in the drop-down menu as you
		type.</li>
	<li>Select the desired term by clicking on it, using either the mouse
		or the keyboard.</li>
	<li>The information for the selected term is displayed. Sections
		include: Definition, Synonyms, References (when applicable), Parent
		classes, Relationships and Example Images (if available).
		There might also be a Comment section, below the definition.</li>
	<li>The References section lists the relevant papers used to define
		that term. Links to the FlyBase Reference Report pages are provided.
	</li>
	<li>The Parent classes list the parent classes of that term in the
		anatomy ontology with links. Clicking on a term displays the
		information page for that term.</li>
	<li>The Relationships section lists all other relationships of that
		term in the ontology with links. These might include part_of,
		connected_to, has_synaptic_terminals_in (pre- or postsynaptic),
		develops_from, etc. Clicking on a term displays an information page
		for that term.</li>
	<li>Below the Relationships section, or when applicable in other
		sections, links to display a neuropil domain in the Stack Viewer are
		provided ('See in Viewer'). Links to the FlyBase and NeuroLex Wiki
		pages for that anatomy term.</li>
	<li>The information displayed in these pages (except for neurons) is
		the same that is displayed in the term info window in the Stack Viewer
		Page .</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to run a query after finding the desired term</h2>

<ul>
	<li> The query menu is on the top of the term info window ('Query
		for'). Hovering on the query options available to the right of 'Query
		for' will display all available query sub-options. Click on the
		desired query sub-option to run the query. </li>
	<li>
		The query menu for a neuron includes search options for: neuron
		subclasses, genes/transgenes and phenotypes associated with that
		neuron. The query menu for a neuropil domain includes searches for
		neuron classes by location and innervation, single neurons by
		location, tracts, gene/transgene expression and phenotypes associated
		with that neuropil domain.
	</li>
	<li>The format of the results page will be different depending on the
		type of query.</li>
	<li>The results are listed on the same window. To preserve your selection of terms in the stack, open the links of the term info window in a new tab, using the right/control click and choosing 'Open link in new tab'. The format will be different depending on the type of query.</li>
		  <li>For neuron classes, tract queries and lineage clones, clicking on 'More info' for a term displays the information for that term. The same information would be displayed in the Anatomy/Neuron Finder page or on the Term info window (if it is a neuropil domain). If images are available, they will be shown as well. To display these on the Viewer, click "See in viewer".</li>
		  <li>For queries for individual neurons by location, the result list shows groups of morphologically similar neurons (clusters), the average neuron of that cluster (exemplar), and the link to members of that cluster (Show individual neurons).</li>
		  <li>Interactive 3D representations (WebGL) of each cluster, together with some more cluster information is available by clicking on the cluster image. </li>
		  <li>The window 'Show individual neurons' displays the neuron name, a thumbnail of the registered neuron ('Neuron preview'), annotations ('Type') and the driver used to label that neuron ('Driver'). To display the neuron in the Viewer, click "See in viewer".
		  </li>
		  <li>For expression queries, the result lists have four columns. The first shows the driver/reporter, gene or alelle, the second displays the relevant anatomy term ('expressed in' or 'phenotype in'), the third lists the references and the fourth displays a thumbnail of the expression patter for that driver (if integrated by the site). The first and third columns link to the appropriate pages on FlyBase. Clicking on a term in the second column displays the information for that term in the same window. It is the same information as in the Anatomy/Neuron Finder Pages or on the Term info window (if it is a neuropil domain).</li>
